# LocalAI
A repo for experiments in building, fine-tuning, and running open-source/open-weight AI models in a local, private, and sometimes portable context.

## Overview
Running open-source/open-weight AI models ((and even proprietary models) in a local, private, and sometimes portable context offer significant advantages in security, efficiency, and accessibility. Running AI locally ensures that sensitive data stays private, reducing reliance on cloud services, and mitigating risks associated with data breaches. Running AI locally can also sometimes result in faster response times by eliminating network latency, making them ideal for real-time applications. Additionally, if the models are wrapped together with all the necessary dependencies to become truly portable, they can run on various devices, from laptops to mobile phones, enabling AI-powered solutions even in low-connectivity environments. In short, local AI gives users greater control and flexibility when working in both personal and enterprise environments regardless of whether they are online or offline.

## Advantages of Local AI
Local AI addresses several of common concerns about AI in general:

- **Fewer Hallucinations**  
  Local models can be fine-tuned on curated, domain-specific data, potentially reducing the likelihood of hallucinations and ensuring outputs align better with user intent.  

- **Increased Privacy and Consent**  
  Since data never leaves the local machine, privacy risks are minimized. Users can train models on datasets they legally own or have permission to use, avoiding ethical concerns around data scraping.  

- **Reduced Bias**  
  With full access to model weights and training data (for pre-training and/or post-training), developers can audit and modify biases rather than relying on opaque, corporate-controlled AI systems.  

- **Sustainable Deployment**  
  While training large models still requires resources, running (and potentially training) smaller, efficient models locally can be cost-effective and energy-efficient, reducing dependence on cloud computing.  

- **Improved Security**  
  Running AI in a private setting eliminates the risk of data exposure through cloud services.  

## Getting Started with Local AI

### Using Hugging Face to learn about the latest open-source/open-weight models
[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) is a leading platform for exploring, developing, and sharing open-source AI models. It provides a vast repository of pre-trained models across various domains, including natural language processing, computer vision, and audio processing. By browsing the [**Models**](https://huggingface.co/models) hub, you can find the latest open-weight models and compare their performance. The platform also offers [**datasets**](https://huggingface.co/datasets) and other resources, making it an essential resource for researchers, developers, and AI enthusiasts.

In theory, you can also use Hugging Face libraries to download and run AI models locally. However, beginners to local AI are likely to find this challenging for two main reasons:
- **Information on model sizes is not immediately clear**<br>
  This means that you may attempt to download a model that is too big to fit into the RAM of your local computer and will not work.

- **Code to run the models locally can be out-of-date**<br>
This means that when you attempt to download and run the model, the code throws an error or doesn't produce any output.

The solution is to use a more user-friendly interface to locate, download, and run AI models.
